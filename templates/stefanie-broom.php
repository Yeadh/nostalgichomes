                                    <p>“The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play”. ~ Arnold J. Toynbee
                                    I love meeting all different kinds of people from all different walks of life and helping to navigate through to moving day. I love the excitement of the hunt for the right home. I love getting to know the people and families that I am helping in the home search. I love the diversity of the Denver neighborhoods and knowing that there is a community to fit everyone. I love that work has felt like play every day since becoming a Realtor.</p>
                                    <p>As a member of the top selling Apel Team I am able to benefit from, as well as contribute to, a reputation of market leadership, hard work, customer service and top results. Having been a broker for a few years now – I have the competitive advantage of more than 40 years of market expertise to draw upon. My favorite part of our team is the added benefit to our clients. Multiple points of view and opinions to help clients as well as the availabilty to meet with clients around their schedule helps us maintain “top team” status year after year.</p>
                                    <p>Every situation and need is different: Buying your first home? Seeking refuge from the city in the peace and quiet of the suburbs? Heading back to the culture and pace of city life? My knowledge of both Denver’s established and up and coming neighborhoods as well as the ins and outs of suburban life make me your ideal real estate professional. I love what I do and look forward to getting to know you during your home search.</p>
                                    <p>My previous (pre-real estate) life was spent with 15 years in “corporate” America working in customer service and sales roles with contractor and manufacturing companies. While there I was recognized for my attention to detail, organization, logical processes, enthusiasm and team work.</p>
                                    <p>While I was not born in this beautiful state, I like to call myself a “Semi-Native”. My family relocated to Arvada from Texas while I was still in elementary school. In addition to spending my formative years here, my mother’s family has had property in the mountains of Boulder County for five generations and I have spent all of my summers enjoying the Colorado sunshine.
                                    When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband, step-son and fur babies (2 spoiled dogs and 1 pretentious kitty). We like to walk and explore dog parks. My attempts at hobbies include gardening (some seasons more successfully than others), knitting (I have one scarf completed that my husband proudly wears) and many other crafts claimed by Pinterest to be “fool-proof.” I excel at getting lost in books as well as exploring new restaurants with friends.</p>
