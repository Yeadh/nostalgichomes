                            <p>“Recently Luis Serrano assisted our family purchase a 1906 charming bungalow at 29th and Irving. A month before we walked into the Nostalgic Homes office after reading about the company in the Denver Business Journal. Luis greeted us and started a warm, friendly professional relationship. Throughout our dealings Luis’ integrity was striking. At closing we felt we had been part of a win-win negotiation.”</p>

                            <p>“Luis helped my wife and I purchase our first home. He is a true professional, and was compassionate, responsive, and competent to each and every one of my concerns. He tirelessly stuck with us through the process, never relenting in our desire to examine local properties. As a newcomer to the home purchase process, I was a bit apprehensive about financing, timelines, contract language, negotiation, condominium issues, and the nuances of purchasing a foreclosure property. Luis provided unbiased guidance through each and every one of these issues. When we encountered issues with financing (I’m self-employed), he provided a key referral to a Denver-based mortgage broker who herself was a truly consummate professional. One is indeed evaluated by the company one keeps, and we were highly impressed with our financing resource. Luis took time to understand our unique personalities and adjusted his approach accordingly. He listened intently to my analytical questions, never once becoming impatient or disinterested. He traveled considerable distances to Longmont from Denver on a moment’s notice. Finally, I’ll note that Luis is highly proficient in cutting-edge technologies that have revolutionized the industry. He is data driven and highly competent in research. I’d use Luis again, and recommend him to my friends.”</p>

                            <p> “Leigh Gauger is a miracle worker!  Less than 5 weeks after our first exploratory call to Nostalgic Homes, we signed contracts to sell our former house and buy our new one.  Ours was not a typical situation, and Leigh found a way to help us get everything we wanted.  She was patient, creative, persistent, and attentive.  We were very lucky to have found her.”</p>

                            <p>“Leigh Gauger was our realtor and she was nothing short of amazing. Now that the dust has settled and boxes have all been emptied, I wanted to express my gratitude for all of Leigh’s hard work as our realtor.</p> 
                            <p>Leigh helped us sell our bungalow in Park Hill and find a larger family home in Baker. She very efficiently sold our home for top dollar. We interviewed three realtors and Leigh recommended listing our home for $45,000 more than the other realtors. Naturally we wanted to make the most money, but we were nervous about such a large difference in price. Ultimately we chose Leigh because of her confidence and friendly disposition. We felt like she genuinely cared about selling our home and finding us a new place. We definitely made the right choice; our house was under contract within one day for full list price! If we would have listed with the other realtors, I am sure our home would have sold fast, but we would have lost out on a lot of profits. Thanks for maximizing our investment Leigh! I was also impressed by the photography of our home, it looked so good in the pictures it almost made me question moving. Almost.</p> 
                            <p>Leigh also did an excellent job helping us navigate the low inventory Denver market. I was very impressed at how well Leigh knew the current housing market. Other realtors we had met with didn’t seem to be keeping pace with ever changing dynamics of the city. It was very apparent that Leigh had an astute knowledge of Denver’s neighborhood and helped us find a new location where our money went further. Ultimately, I am most appreciative of Leigh’s commitment and responsiveness. With so few houses on the market timing is everything. Leigh opened up her schedule and was able to show us homes on just a couple hours notice. To ensure we got our dream home, Leigh was corresponding with me until10:00pm writing up an offer. Needless to say we got the house and Leigh did an excellent job negotiating on our behalf. The next time we move (hopefully not for a while) we will definitely be contacting Leigh!”</p>

                            <p>“Leigh is a one of a kind broker that I would whole heartedly recommend to any developer or seller.  Northwest Denver is lucky to have her in the neighborhood.  From start to finish, Leigh took my projects to heart offering clear and valuable insights from floor plans to staging to get my projects sold.  She diligently worked with all potential buyers, following up for weeks, months, even years to get to the closing table.  She has a unique knack for keeping your product in the buyer’s mind without being too pushy.  Leigh works to make each sale a win-win between buyer and seller so both can be equally happy.  The buyers and buyer brokers of my properties have all complimented Leigh’s professionalism and diligence in making sales happen.  She knows her stuff, she knows Northwest Denver and she knows how to close.  Leigh is my broker.”</p>

                            <p>“I worked with Leigh and she was fantastic!  She was our realtor for two sales…not only were we buying a new home but also selling our current home.  The purchase of our new home was contingent on the sale of our current home.  In addition, we were expecting our second child in just a few months and time was of the essence.  Leigh was great to work with. She would tell us what we needed to do in order to get our home sold, she had wonderful ideas and they all worked.  We were able to get our home under contract in just 4 days! Unbelievable because it was right during the collapse of the market. I would highly recommend Leigh to any home buyer or seller. She is very knowledgeable about the market, very flexible and a joy to work with.”</p>

                            <p>“When selecting an agent to help sell our home, we were very impressed with Leigh’s sales record, professionalism, and enthusiasm.   From start to finish, we felt as though the sale of our home was her very top priority.   During the short time our house was on the market, Leigh was constantly researching other homes in the area to help us decide on what our strategy would be.  As a result, we had a constant stream of showings, and eventually had a buyer.  Leigh adapted very well to unusual circumstances that popped up along the way, and we were extremely impressed with her resourcefulness to get all of the available information to us to make decisions along the way.   We believe that it was her knowledge of the market, marketing strategy, and energy that contributed to the quick sale of our home.   We would definitely go to Leigh for any future property needs and highly recommend her to others looking for an exceptional agent.”</p>

                            <p>“Leigh helped me purchase my first home.  When it came time to decide which house to buy, I was finicky to say the least…someone who doesn’t purchase anything retail without first reading Consumer Reports and doing extensive research.  So when it came time to buying a home, I wanted to feel secure in knowing that the home I was purchasing was well constructed and that the price was reasonable.  Leigh’s extensive background in construction and real estate was reassuring.  She was able to effectively communicate both the positives and negatives of the homes I was considering and what price I should expect to pay.  Leigh put my mind at ease that the home I eventually ended up purchasing was exactly the right home for me.  Not only was Leigh knowledgeable about the Denver market, but home hunting with Leigh was a blast!  Over the 3 months we were searching, not a single day passed when we didn’t laugh.”</p>

                            <p>“Approximately May, 2014, my spouse and I were considering selling one of our rental properties and decided to interview a number of realtors to ascertain the best professional which would best fit our needs, desires, and personalities. As with most professionals dealing with the public, they were exuberant, kind and professional during our meeting. Both my spouse and I were up front with the fact we were looking for someone who would journey with us on a path to sell our property. The catch was we still had a tenant living in our property and we were not going to evict the party to sell our rental property.</p> 
                            <p>All interviewed realtors disappeared when they found out we would not evict our tenant, the exception was Leigh Gauger. Leigh stayed in touch with us while the other realtors had other fish to catch. The mark of a true professional is one who is willing to go the “extra mile” to develop their clientele for the purposes of working (serving) for them.</p> 
                            <p>Leigh Gauger is an accomplished realtor. She is kind, a very good listener, anticipates our every need and responds very quickly to any question or situation. Leigh was very patient with a couple who had some entrenched emotions about letting go of a property that had been a part of our lives for close to 40 years. Leigh is a stellar professional by keeping us informed through every step of our journey, and on the day of closing, was present continuing her professionalism.</p> 
                            <p>Should my spouse and I ever need another realtor, my first call will be to Leigh Gauger. We wanted a good experience selling our property and obtained a “superb experience”. We highly recommend Leigh Gauger for your journey.”</p>

She has lived in Denver a long time and knows the neighborhoods, the hot spots, the well-kept secrets AND the best places to land a deal. We had lost out on a house — it went under contract right after we saw it during the open house. Leigh made such an impression with the selling agent that when the deal fell through, the agent called her to see if we still wanted it before it was ever listed again! This was our first home purchase and she was right by our side throughout the whole process. She was readily available with assistance and answers — I got emails and texts from her well into the evening when it was necessary. It’s like she never stops working for you. If you’re looking for someone who will walk you through buying and selling a home — and do it with a smile, Leigh is your realtor. She’s great!”</p>

My wife and I jumped into the market a bit too soon and had to back out, but Angelica was there waiting for us with a smile a year later. She remembered our style and we fell in love with the first place Angelica showed us. Although we were hooked on the first home, Angelica was more than happy to show us more places to make sure we had good comparisons. It’s such a tough market to get into in Denver, but Angelica helped us to remain competitive and eventually, we got that first house. She knows this city and knows it well. Plus she’s got a ton of contacts in remodeling and whatever else you need.</p>
                            <p>Angelica is always a pleasure to work with. She’ll get the job done and after you close she’ll still be there for you if you need her.  Angelica will definitely our realtor whenever we need one and she should be yours too.”</p>

Our expectations were not only around the house we were looking for but also of the broker that assisted us with our purchase. Angelica met all of our expectations and more. When we found the right home my husband and I made our first offer, only to figure out the price and quality of the home were out of the question. Angelica helped steer us in the right direction even though the first home we made our offer on was not the right fit. When we finally did find the right home, Angelica went to work for us and contended with the selling agent and seller. After the whole process was over, the countless hours of searching and going under contract, Angelica continued to be accommodating and supportive. She genuinely made the whole process of searching for a home as well as going under contract on a home seamless and virtually pain free. Angelica did a great job of working behind the scenes to ensure our happiness and interests. I would gladly work with Angelica again; my husband and I didn’t only feel like first time home buyers… Angelica took care of us as if we were her only client.”</p>

                            <p>“Angelica was my 5th (Broker) to try and I stuck with her for a good reason.  My previous 4 (Brokers) took a very bland assessment of what I was looking for in a home, and set me up with automated emails/sites which sent me 95% garbage.</p> 
                            <p>What I appreciated about Angelica was that she took time to figure out the criteria I was interested in as well as taking note of my personal taste based on the houses we visited. The more houses we saw, the more refined her prospective homes became. I didn’t get a bunch of stuff simply at the top tier of my price range, she sought out homes she knew I would show like to see. I would say that easily 75% if not more of the houses she emailed me I had an interest in seeing.</p> 
                            <p>It really helped having someone filter out the garbage and hone in on exactly what I was looking for in a home. I can say without a doubt, the house I finally bought, after having 2 contracts fall through, is my favorite house yet and has absolutely everything I was hoping for, but not expecting, in my price range.</p> 
                            <p>She was ALWAYS prompt in either answering calls/texts or responding as soon as possible, which I greatly appreciated. I’ve recommended her to several others browsing the market and will continue to refer her.”</p>

                            <p>“I want to first say that the level of commitment that I received from Angelica Apel of Nostalgic Homes far exceeded my expectations. Not only is Angelica a true professional in all that she does, she goes a step further, she does her “homework” in all aspects, she first asks the most important question, “tell me exactly what you are looking for in a home and a neighborhood”, then she gets to know you, and from there she becomes an investigator. She provides background on all of the properties that she offers up for your review. She knows what the schools are like, she provides you insight and tips on how to review a prospective home and area. Then she guides you through any possible hazards that there might be. She provides multiple areas for loans and financing, and they are only the highest caliber. Once you find your dream house, her expertise really kicks in, she keeps you focused on the pending dates and what you have to do to make the closing happen. What helped me the most, she advised me on what ‘not to worry about’, she made that her job, which made my job very, very easy, which was to enjoy and settle into my new home.</p> 
                            <p>I have spoken of her abilities to everyone I know, and feel that my family and I have also made a cherished friend. Thank you Angelica.”</p>

                            <p>“I contacted Nostalgic Homes when I decided that I wanted to get in the market for a new home. I have to say my initial choice in an agency was not very scientific, I picked Nostalgic Homes because I really liked there signs I had seen through the Highlands area. I had found a house that I wanted to see and Angelica came out and showed the home to me.</p> 
                            <p>My first impression of Angelica was that she was very professional, she was on time and made a great first impression. We talked about what I wanted in a home and what I thought I could afford. Angelica quickly helped me get in touch with a mortgage agent who explained to me what I could get financed for and helped me organize my finances to improve my buying power. Angelica was very open to my input on what style, type of home, size and lot sizing I was looking for, she tailored her house searches to the area I wanted to be in and every time we went out and looked at houses she got more and more dialed in to exactly what I was looking for. She did not try to push me into a cookie cutter ranch home even though there were tons on the market.</p>
                            <p>Did I mention that Angelica was extremely flexible in her scheduling?  I work grave yards and she was able to meet me very early in the morning, mid day, or during evening hours on week days and weekends alike to look at houses. At no time did I feel like Angelica was pressuring me to buy any specific house and she was quick to point out if she thought a house was over priced in the market. When I found homes I was interested in Angelica would pull comps so we could see if they were priced appropriately. When I would get bummed out about missing out on a house Angelica was very reassuring that she would help me find the perfect home for me and my family which, is exactly what she did. Angelica found me a home that met every criteria I was looking for that was within my budget and the area I was looking for.</p>
                            <p>Angelica was at my side from start to finish through the home buying process and I couldn’t have asked for more out of an agent. I highly recommend her as an agent and can happily say if I am in the market again she will be my agent in the future. Put your trust in her and Nostalgic Homes and you will not be disappointed!”</p>

                            <p>In August 2011, I decided to start looking myself for houses in the Highlands , Hi-Lo areas, after I became frustrated with my real estate agent, and their lack of attention to my cause. I literally began to drive the streets bordered by I-25 on east, I-70 on north, Sheridan on west, and Colfax on south. During these street by street forays, I just happened to stop by 32nd and Newton, where Nostalgic Homes (NH) main office is located. Sitting at the desk was Angelica Apel, a broker with NH. I asked Angelica if she could help me find a home. That night I had more than 25 homes in the area I wanted, with price information, sent by Angelica via email. I contacted Angelica again the next day, and she agreed to set aside time for me later that afternoon, to meet again at NH, to discuss possible purchases. Later that week we visited several homes, and 3 weeks later, I was making arrangements to close on the home of my choice. Angelica was very good at understanding what I wanted, and cutting to the chase, eliminating needless visits to homes that I had no interest in. Angelica was also good at follow up. One thing I might add is, at the time I was working at my job , at a very remote mine in Peru. I was also in the process of having spine surgery , and going back and forth between Peru and Denver, several times in the span of a couple months. Angelica would call my Peruvian number, and also keep track of me when I was in Miami, or travelling. That is to say, I couldn’t find a Denver Real estate agent that would even get back to me when I was in town, needless to say putting up with these difficult logistics, as Angelica did. Angelica used simple techniques, i.e.to do lists to complete, and often served as a go-between with my lender, inspectors, etc. which really didn’t fall within her scope of duties. More than anything, Angelica’s attitude leveled the field for everyone, myself, the lender, the inspections, etc.</p>

Jodi recommended wonderful resources while we prepared our home for sale utilizing a wonderful stager and photographer among others. Our home looked fantastic and sold in 8 days at full price. We found our new home the next day and Jodi was able to work the closings for the same day and before we knew it, we were settled in our part of town. Jodi made this process extremely simple, guiding us at a pace that still made the process exciting. I would recommend Jodi to anyone in the Denver area. We transitioned from a historic, urban area to a contemporary suburb and Jodi managed all of this with a great deal of knowledge in all areas. I am grateful for all Jodi did for us during our transition.”</p>

She was diligent in her search and made sure I was notified immediately when something that she thought would interest me came on the market. Once we found the perfect place, she made sure we had the winning offer. Her attention to every detail from the offer through the final negotiation was extremely helpful. She really cared that I would be happy throughout the process and made sure every aspect of the process went smoothly through the close. I am in my new place and I love it! The entire process was seamless thanks to Liz!”</p>

We were very nervous entering the competitive housing market in Denver, but Liz was on top of everything, every step of the way! She was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and responsive, and willing to go the extra mile to help us get our dream home. Thanks to Liz, we sold our home, purchased a new home, and closed on both within 36 days. We will continue to sing her praises to our friends in the Denver area!”</p>

We are so thankful that we found Liz Luna with Nostalgic Homes. The consummate professional, Liz guided us through the entire process with kindness, patience, and tact,and demonstrated the know how and negotiating skills to close the deal. We genuinely got the sense that Liz had our best interests at heart and never felt pushed or hurried.  At the same time, Liz kept in close contact with us, diligently keeping us updated as new listings came available and always making herself available to us – something extremely important in a competitive housing market. At closing, the seller informed us that Liz’s professionalism, coupled with the reputation of Nostalgic Homes, was a significant factor in deciding to accept our offer, giving us credibility as buyers and ultimately leading to our first home purchase. We enthusiastically recommend Liz to any prospective buyers (or sellers!) and look forward to working with her again in future transactions.</p>

                            <p>“As a young single gal in my 20’s, the thought of purchasing a home was daunting but I knew renting forever wasn’t the best choice for me. I came across Liz as I was inquiring about homes for sale. I am so happy I did. While I was still in the process of deciding if purchasing a home was right for me, Liz was up for the challenge. As a first time home buyer, Liz was extremely helpful and patient in every step of the way. She told me all about the home buying process and showed me numerous properties that fit my requirements. Along with learning about real estate, she showed me around the Highlands where I wanted to live and seemed to know the area better than the back of her hand. The commitment to helping me and her fondness of the neighborhood truly shined and made me want to work with her as well as solidify my decision to live in the neighborhood. She made what seemed like a nerve wracking experience a fun and enjoyable one. After a few weeks of looking at homes, our first offer was accepted. She was there every step of the way to guide me through the process of home inspections, appraisals and everything in between. When I couldn’t make it to an appointment due to work, she would be there in a blink of an eye. She even helped find me the best loan originator which was a huge help as well. Overall, Liz made what seem like a daunting ordeal into a pleasant experience, and now I can call myself a proud homeowner! I would recommend Liz, along with Nostalgic Homes, to anyone considering buying a home or just thinking about it.”</p>

She was dead-on correct that the house was worth the asking price (which was under our budget limit) and we were thrilled when the house was appraised at significantly more than the contract price. She knew instinctively, and by asking the right questions, what we wanted, and wasn’t afraid to tell us when we found it that it was the right one and would not last. She is incredibly knowledgeable about Denver, and a joy to work with. I would recommend her to anyone.”</p>

Jill is a hard worker and was always available for us to view houses and was willing to do as many open houses on our as it took to sell it. I am recommending Jill and her team to all my friends.

                            <p>“We both sold our old home and bought our new home through Nostalgic Homes and would highly recommend them. There are only a few times in your life when you sell your home. It is a personal and often gut-wrenching. It is complicated and you need someone who is on your side and gives you good advice and guides you through the maze of real estate. It was important from our first meeting to make sure Nostaligic Homes shared our values: that they were trust worthy, hard working, integrous and would be our advocates. Most importantly, we felt they LISTENED to us and took the time and energy to understand our situation, our goals and our concerns.</p> 
                            <p>Throughout the process they gave us strong advice, answered our questions and clarified our concerns. Selling our house in a down real estate market was not easy, but with Nostalgic Homes on our side, it helped manage the anxiety. In addition, they gave us references for home financing experts that transformed our financing options in ways our bank never advised us.</p> 
                            <p>As a family of 5 with two young babies, a 12-year-old a dog and a cat, it was important that we were able to show our home and still be able to live in our house. They arranged showings that were non-intrusive and worked closely with us to make sure our house was professionaly staged to gain greater interest from buyers.</p> 
                            <p>I know we are only one family, but we are huge advocates of Nostalgic Homes and recommend them to all our family and friends.”</p>

                            <p>“It is our pleasure to recommend Corey Wadley to anyone searching for the ideal home for their unique situation.  Living in Northern California, where housing inventories are low and real estate prices are high, we spent the last 5 years in search of a single family home without success.  After much soul searching we came to the realization that homeownership was not in our future in California.  With family in Colorado, we had been visiting the area for 20 years and always enjoyed our annual trips here.  Once we were able to let go of the idea of staying permanently in California, it was a no-brainer to restart our search in Denver.</p>
                            <p>While we have family in the area, none had a recommendation for a Realtor they could pass along, only horror stories of prior experiences they could share.  We decided to contact Nostalgic Homes after an exhaustive internet search of all Realtor websites we could find.  Nostalgic Homes had the most sales and listings of the type of home we were looking for, a Bungalow with vintage details intact, in the area we had expected we would end up in, the Highlands.  Though once we found CongressPark, we knew it was where we needed to be, and it was Corey that helped us get there.  He gave us a level of attention we would never have guessed we could receive from the owner knowing they are very busy with day-to-day operations.</p> <p>We found Corey to be a highly attentive agent, almost as if we were his only customer, although we know that was not the case.  We never felt neglected or unimportant.  Easy to talk to, good at listening to his clients, easily available, and at all times quick at returning our calls or to respond to our queries, often late into the evening.  He did not waste our time with homes that were out of our price range or not in line with our needs.  As a professional real estate agent, Corey knows all the tricks of the trade.  As a master at contract negotiations, Corey came up with a deal that was good for us and made the seller happy as well.  In really tough times, he helped us to accomplish what we had not been able to the previous 5 years in California.</p>
                            <p>Relocating from San Francisco, we never expected that the real estate environment in Denver would be as difficult as what we had been experiencing in California.  We were grateful to have found Corey to help us negotiate the difficult market here.  It’s because of him that we found the perfect house in a terrific location and within our budget.</p>
                            <p>Above all, Corey is one real estate agent who makes it a point to help you meet your purpose rather than just fulfilling his goals.  We strongly recommend Corey Wadley.”</p>

                            <p>“I have to thank both Corey Wadley and Jenny Apel for their experience, professionalism, and patience as my wife and I searched for our dream home. While our goals and our budget didn’t always line up, Corey showed us a range of options in order to help us narrow in on our final house, pushed back on us at just the right time to help us make smarter decisions, and ultimately was crucial in negotiating on our behalf. After months of searching, he helped us land the home of our dreams on Lookout Mountain in Golden, CO and I’d highly recommend his service and the whole organization for anyone looking for a home in Colorado.”</p>

                            <p>“I sold my first home located in another state and moved to Denver a couple of years ago. After renting a house in the Wash Park area during that time, I had time to explore and experience other Denver area neighborhoods. I was drawn to the NW side of Denver, particularly because of the close proximity to downtown for work along with the growing number of highly rated neighborhood restaurants for grubbing, small pubs for socializing, and unique upscale retail locations. After making the decision to buy a home and performing my own due diligence in finding an area for which to do so, I quickly realized I needed to do the same in finding a broker to start viewing houses; and if I were to find one, represent me in the transaction. I spent countless hours reading reviews of various real estate companies in addition to asking friends and co-workers for recommendations. I wanted a broker than knew the area I wanted to call home and ultimately found that in Corey Wadley with Nostalgic Homes.</p> 
                            <p>Corey was extremely responsive and thorough in our correspondence from the very beginning taking time to address all of my questions in detail. I greatly appreciated this as naturally the more I know and understand; the more comfortable I am in the situation. I explained to Corey exactly what I was looking for in a house and the price range I wanted to stay within. The process was much less stressful for me in that these were the types of listings I consistently received for my review – there were no attempts to go outside my comfort zone or pressure tactics like needing to “jump on this now”.  I also appreciated Corey taking time to include his professional insight for listings that caught his eye with a few remarks as to why. In addition, there was never a time that Corey wasn’t willing to schedule around my limited availability to show me a house or schedule a phone call for a time convenient for me.</p>
                            <p>With Corey’s help, I was able to find THE home I was looking for in little over a month! The listing was posted to the MLS in late afternoon and Corey was ready to show me the house when I was available after work.  I knew immediately that this house was for me and was ready to make an offer! Knowing it was getting pretty late in the evening, I hesitantly asked when we could draw up an offer as I already knew I was keeping him from dinner (I still feel bad about that, Corey!). We spent the next few hours at his office late into the evening pulling comps to make a competitive offer. Corey was overall very knowledgeable in all areas including being able to accurately answer my questions of the mortgage process and available loan programs, as well as, recommend to me Cherry Creek Mortgage who was able to close my loan on time without hassle, cheaper in closing costs, and at the same rates offered by my banking institution. After the accepted offer, Corey kept me on top of the needed inspection deadlines, successfully re-negotiated with the seller’s side on a few finds after the inspections, and everything else needed through final closing day. Now that a few months have passed, I’ve had time to reflect on my purchase and still could not be happier with my new home or the overall experience offered by Corey Wadley and Nostalgic Homes.”</p>

                            <p>“When it was time for our family to find a home with more space, we knew we had many options for a Realtor. As long time residents of NW Denver, we were familiar with Nostalgic Homes and their reputation of being neighborhood experts, yet the service and expertise that Corey provided was beyond our expectations. Corey graciously provided insight into the many neighborhoods within NW Denver including schools. In addition to knowing the neighborhood literally block by block, he provided insight into the many different dwelling types and construction our neighborhood contains.  When we found our “perfect” house, Corey assisted us in making sure our offer stood out and was accepted.  Throughout our home buying process, we found Corey to strike the perfect balance between calm, organized, and efficient.  We would most certainly work again with Corey and his team. Top notch!”</p>
